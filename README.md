This is a project for al the Alta3 servers given in the course.

It downloads a hello world project on public github.

First it goes to the servers to install the proper dependencies.

python3
python3-pip
git
In this case there was an error with one server so it check the OS and checked if is a Debian or a RedHat systems.

and finally it clones the repository.

Notes for Professor Hutch: Hope you still remember me. When we where on class you told me to continue the project I was working on class. So I just add some things more but is basically this and is working fine. If you think there is something missing please tell me.
